This is a module I hacked together quickly after having read the following
blog post:
http://blog.notdot.net/archives/30-Damn-Cool-Algorithms,-Part-1-BK-Trees.html

I thought the data structure sounded cool so I thought it would be an 
interesting excerise to implement it. 

BK-trees can apparently perform very good in some circumstances. The 
paper "Fast Approximate String Matching in a Dictionary" (Baeza-Yates, 
Navarro 1998) recommends them over other structures for doing 
approximate search.

Henning GÃ¼nter <h.guenther@tu-bs.de> generously supplied two algorithms for
computing the levenshtein edit distance. The better one of the two is used in
the list instance for the Metric class.
