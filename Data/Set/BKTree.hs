   Burhard-Keller trees provide an implementation of sets which apart
   from the ordinary operations also has an approximate member search,
   allowing you to search for elements that are of a distance @n@ from
   the element you are searching for. The distance is determined using
   a metric on the type of elements. Therefore all elements must
   implement the 'Metric' type class, rather than the more usual
   'Ord'.

   Useful metrics include the manhattan distance between two points,
   the Levenshtein edit distance between two strings, the number of
   edges in the shortest path between two nodes in a undirected graph
   and the Hamming distance between two binary strings. Any euclidean
   space also has a metric. However, in this module we use int-valued
   metrics and that doesn't quite with the metrics of euclidean spaces
   which are real-values.

   The worst case complexity of many of these operations is quite bad,
   but the expected behavior varies greatly with the metric. For
   example, the discrete metric (@distance x y | y == x = 0 |
   otherwise = 1@) makes BK-trees behave abysmally. The metrics
   mentioned above should give good performance characteristics.

-- | A type is 'Metric' if is has a function 'distance' which has the following
-- properties:
--
-- * @'distance' x y >= 0@
--
-- * @'distance' x y == 0@ if and only if @x == y@
--
-- * @'distance' x y == 'distance' y x@
--
-- * @'distance' x z <= 'distance' x y + 'distance' y z@
--
-- All types of elements to 'BKTree' must implement 'Metric'.
--
-- This definition of a metric deviates from the mathematical one in that it
-- returns an integer instead of a real number. The reason for choosing 
-- integers is that I wanted to avoid the rather unpredictable rounding
-- of floating point numbers.
